Problem Statement: How many times have you felt unsafe getting back to home late night? Often especially women feel unsafe when they are visting strange and new places. And many crimes such as sexual assault or harrasssment go unnoiticed because we do not feel comfortable sharing.

Motive: Crowdsource un-reported crime using Social Media as a tool. Presently we have used Twitter as the primary social media datasource and we intend to explore other reliable data sources.

Description:

Features:

Personalized hashtag -> "#crimebuzz" Crowdsourcing to understand unnoticed crime -> Any user who is a witness of crimes like sexual assault, harrasment, etc. he/she can tweet about the incident with our hashtag. A photo would be helpful but not compulsory.
